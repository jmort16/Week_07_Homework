# What is auto-incrementing?
Auto-incrementing is designed to save time by automatically assigning a new value in the primary key column for each row (including new ones).  By default, it will start at 1 and count by ones.  However, the user can choose to start with 10 and count by fives (for example).

# What is the difference between creating a join and a subquery?
Creating a join allows the user to join multiple tables together by some common column heading (...attribute...?).  Then the user can filter, sort, and otherwise manipulate the new, larger table based on the information needed.  Creating a subquery allows the user to break down a complex query into more manageable parts.  This means that it's easier to build a query because the user approaches each portion of the query individually.  In short, joining is typically quicker but messier than subquery.
